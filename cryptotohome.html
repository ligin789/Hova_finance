            Bringing decentralised financing services closer to people has been the core of Hova’s modus operandi. The Crypto services, although started to benefit people by swaying away from the conventional and established customs, is still far from their reach.
            The two major attributes to this issue are: <br><br>
            <ul class="list-unstyled mt-2">
                <li class="mb-3 ml-4 d-flex text-left">
                    <img src="./assets/images/bullet.svg" class="mr-3" width="25" alt="Point :"> Lack of awareness leading to scepticism against CryptoCurrency.

                </li>
                <li class="mb-3 ml-4 d-flex">
                    <img src="./assets/images/bullet.svg" width="25" class="mr-3" alt="Point :"> Lack of digital literacy.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br> We all can relate to the first reason, and at one point in time, each Crypto investor was sceptic about this new technology. Gradually people learnt and started investing, many gaining huge profits that made news and eventually attracting
            more and more investors. The success of Bitcoin is a live example, that is now being used at a far greater pace due to uncensored and free transactions.<br><br>A large portion of our population still doesn’t prefer using smartphones and high-tech
            gadgets. This ‘portion’ often includes the elderly who don’t know how to use a smartphone, or financially drained people who don’t have access to a smartphone or perhaps prefer using cash over digital payments. While teaching everyone to become
            digitally literate is practically lesser possible, Hova aims to solve this problem for the Crypto industry.
