            Paying with biometrics is a revolutionary feature by Hova where its users will be able to make or receive payments using their biometrics, like face, fingerprint, or voice using advanced recognition features installed in Hova’s decentralised financing
            features. <br><br> Let us learn by example.<br>

            <br>John is happy to go, lucky man, working in an American multinational company. During his break time, he likes to take a look at the market conditions and invests his money intelligently, and has brought a bunch of Hova coins with which
            he trades in NFTs and getting extra gigs for payment using Hova’s freelancer services.

            <br><br>He is given a tour to Europe to attend some business meetings for the company. However, during his stay overseas, John realised that he had spent most of his money on other stuff and wasn’t left with enough cash to purchase that exotic
            French Leroy Musigny wine he had promised his wife to bring. <br><br>Nevertheless, John knew his investments with Hova were still safe with him and that he didn’t even need to carry plastic money to make his purchase in France. Just a few
            hours before going to the airport, he orders his driver to take a turn to one of those famous wine stores in the area, and selected his gift. Upon payment, John didn’t use any fiat money to pay, instead he just pressed his finger against the
            fingerprint sensor integrated with Hova’s Crypto Kiosk at the store, entered his PIN and made his purchase.

            <br><br>This technology will also be revolutionary in making payments for emergency services, where a patient’s credentials could be verified by the hospital authorities and they would be paid for their services by biometrics. This reduces
            the wait for companies to clear dues, making payments more transparent and usable during times of emergency.
            <br><br>Apart from Facial, FIngerprint, and Voice recognition, Hova also provides transaction services as easily as getting a One-Time-Password on your phone via SMS or even by scanning a QR code.
